Depending on where you work, the latency in your data warehouse is often several hours to days old. This problem gets exacerbated as data volumes grow. With Artie Transfer, you can reduce data latency from several hours to sub-minute by leveraging change data capture (CDC).

Here's why you should use Artie Transfer:

- It's easy to use: just set up a simple configuration file, and you're good to go!
- It provides sub-minute latency.
- It has automatic table creation and schema detection.
- It provides automatic retries and its processing is idempotent.
- It's built to scale: handle anywhere from 1GB to 100+ TB of data.
- It has built-in error reporting along with rich telemetry stats.

Take a look at the [Getting started](#getting-started) on how to get started with Artie Transfer!

## Architecture

### Pre-requisites
As you can see from the architecture above, Transfer sits behind Kafka and expects CDC messages to be in a particular format. Please see the currently supported section on what sources and destinations are supported.

The optimal set-up looks something like this:
* Kafka topic per table (so we can toggle number of partitions based on throughput)
* Partition key is the primary key for the table (so we avoid out-of-order writes at the row level)

To see all of the supported databases, check out the [Supported section](#what-is-currently-supported)

## What is currently supported?
Transfer is aiming to provide coverage across all OLTPs and OLAPs databases. Currently Transfer supports:

- Message Queues
  - Kafka (default)
  - Google Pub/Sub

- [Destinations](https://docs.artie.so/real-time-destinations/overview):
    - Snowflake
    - BigQuery
    - Redshift
    - S3

- [Sources](https://docs.artie.so/real-time-sources/overview):
    - MongoDB
    - PostgreSQL, we support the following replication slot plug-ins: `pgoutput, decoderbufs, wal2json`
    - MySQL

_If the database you are using is not on the list, feel free to file for a [feature request](https://github.com/artie-labs/transfer/issues/new)._

## Telemetry

[Artie Transfer's telemetry guide](https://docs.artie.so/telemetry/overview)

## Tests
Transfer is written in Go and uses [counterfeiter](https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld/counterfeiter) to mock. 
To run the tests, run the following commands:

```sh
make generate
make test
```

## Release

Artie Transfer is released through [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/), and we use it to cross-compile our binaries on the [releases](https://github.com/artie-labs/transfer/releases) as well as our Dockerhub. If your operating system or architecture is not supported, please file a feature request!
