Artie Transfer is a real-time data replication solution for databases and data warehouses/lakes.

Typical ETL solutions rely on batched processes or schedulers (i.e. DAGs, Airflow), which means the data in the downstream data warehouse is often several hours to days old. This problem is exacerbated as data volumes grow, as batched processes take increasingly longer to run.

Artie leverages change data capture (CDC) and stream processing to perform data syncs in a more efficient way, which enables sub-minute latency.

Benefits of Artie Transfer:

- Sub-minute data latency: always have access to live production data.
- Ease of use: just set up a simple configuration file, and you're good to go!
- Automatic table creation and schema detection: Artie infers schemas and automatically merges changes to downstream destinations.
- Reliability: Artie has automatic retries and processing is idempotent.
- Scalability: handle anywhere from 1GB to 100+ TB of data.
- Monitoring: built-in error reporting along with rich telemetry statistics.
